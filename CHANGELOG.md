v0.4.1  (10 May 2020)
========
+ Add rate control for streams
+ Test against kRPC TestServer 0.4.7

v0.4.0  (24 Oct 2017)
========
+ **Updated to make kRPC-rb compatible with kRPC server version 0.4.0**:
  + **Updated communication protocol in line with server changes** (for details see [krpc #325](https://github.com/krpc/krpc/pull/325))
  + Updated `RPCError` handling logic, to properly handle `Error` protobuf message
  + Updated `core` service
+ Added `KRPC::Version` module, to support more granular version checks
+ Improved `Encoder` - strings are now transcoded to UTF-8 before being encoded as value of protobuf message field. This allows non-UTF-8 encoded strings to be passed to RPC methods, e.g.:

```ruby
client.space_center.active_vessel.name = "Âµ-craft".encode('ISO-8859-1')
```

+ Improved reliability - added many new specs and refactored existing ones for better maintainability and performance
+ Many minor bug fixes, refactorings and performance improvements
