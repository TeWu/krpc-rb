            <pre>                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#x000A;                      Version 3, 29 June 2007&#x000A;Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;&#x000A;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#x000A;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#x000A;&#x000A;                           Preamble&#x000A;&#x000A; The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</pre>
            
            <p>software and other kinds of works.</p>
            
            <pre>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</pre>
            
            <p>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the
            GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
            and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software
            for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
            Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
            released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
            
            <pre>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</pre>
            
            <p>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
            the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
            you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
            you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
            that you know you can do these things.</p>
            
            <pre>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</pre>
            
            <p>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
            certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
            you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
            
            <pre>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</pre>
            
            <p>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
            that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
            the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
            rights.</p>
            
            <pre>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</pre>
            
            <p>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
            you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
            
            <pre>For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains</pre>
            
            <p>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and
            authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
            changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
            authors of previous versions.</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Some</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">devices</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">are</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">designed</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">to</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">deny</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">users</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">access</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">to</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">install</span> <span class="ruby-keyword">or</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">run</span></pre>
            
            <p>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
            can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
            users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such
            abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
            precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this
            version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such
            problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend
            this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to
            protect the freedom of users.</p>
            
            <pre>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</pre>
            
            <p>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
            on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the
            special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it
            effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
            cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
            
            <pre>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</pre>
            
            <p>modification follow.</p>
            
            <pre>                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#x000A;0. Definitions.&#x000A;&#x000A;&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#x000A;&#x000A;&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</pre>
            
            <p>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
            
            <pre>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</pre>
            
            <p>License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
            “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
            
            <pre>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</pre>
            
            <p>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
            exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
            earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
            
            <pre>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</pre>
            
            <p>on the Program.</p>
            
            <pre>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</pre>
            
            <p>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement
            under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or
            modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with
            or without modification), making available to the public, and in some
            countries other activities as well.</p>
            
            <pre>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</pre>
            
            <p>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a
            computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">An</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">interactive</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">user</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">interface</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">displays</span> <span class="ruby-string">&quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</span></pre>
            
            <p>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
            that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
            that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
            warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
            License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents
            a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
            list meets this criterion.</p>
            
            <pre>1. Source Code.&#x000A;The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</pre>
            
            <p>for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source form of
            a work.</p>
            
            <pre>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</pre>
            
            <p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
            interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
            widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
            
            <pre>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</pre>
            
            <p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
            packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component,
            and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or
            to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available
            to the public in source code form.  A “Major Component”, in this context,
            means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
            specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
            compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to
            run it.</p>
            
            <pre>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</pre>
            
            <p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
            run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control
            those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#39;s System
            Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs
            which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not
            part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
            definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source
            code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
            is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
            or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
            
            <pre>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</pre>
            
            <p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
            
            <pre>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</pre>
            
            <p>same work.</p>
            
            <pre>2. Basic Permissions.&#x000A;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</pre>
            
            <p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
            conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
            permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
            covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
            content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights
            of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
            
            <pre>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</pre>
            
            <p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
            force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
            having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
            facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms
            of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control
            copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do
            so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms
            that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material
            outside their relationship with you.</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Conveying</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">under</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">any</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">other</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">circumstances</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">is</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">permitted</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">solely</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">under</span></pre>
            
            <p>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
            it unnecessary.</p>
            
            <pre>3. Protecting Users&#39; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#x000A;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</pre>
            
            <p>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of
            the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
            prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.</p>
            
            <pre>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</pre>
            
            <p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
            effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
            covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
            modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#39;s
            users, your or third parties&#39; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
            technological measures.</p>
            
            <pre>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#x000A;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source code as you</pre>
            
            <p>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
            appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep
            intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms
            added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
            of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
            License along with the Program.</p>
            
            <pre>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</pre>
            
            <p>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
            
            <pre>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#x000A;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</pre>
            
            <p>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of
            section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
            
            <pre>  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#x000A;  it, and giving a relevant date.&#x000A;  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#x000A;  released under this License and any conditions added under section&#x000A;  7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#x000A;  &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#x000A;&#x000A;  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#x000A;  License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#x000A;  License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#x000A;  additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#x000A;  regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#x000A;  permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#x000A;  invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#x000A;&#x000A;  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#x000A;  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#x000A;  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#x000A;  work need not make them do so.&#x000A;&#x000A;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</pre>
            
            <p>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
            which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a
            volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
            compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
            legal rights of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual
            works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause
            this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>
            
            <pre>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#x000A;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</pre>
            
            <p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
            Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</p>
            
            <pre>  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#x000A;  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#x000A;  customarily used for software interchange.&#x000A;  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#x000A;  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#x000A;  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#x000A;  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#x000A;  model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#x000A;  copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#x000A;  product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#x000A;  medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#x000A;  more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#x000A;  conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#x000A;&#x000A;  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#x000A;  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#x000A;  alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#x000A;  only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#x000A;  with subsection 6b.&#x000A;&#x000A;  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#x000A;  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#x000A;  further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#x000A;  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#x000A;  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#x000A;  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#x000A;  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#x000A;  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#x000A;  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#x000A;&#x000A;  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#x000A;  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#x000A;  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#x000A;  charge under subsection 6d.&#x000A;&#x000A;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</pre>
            
            <p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
            conveying the object code work.</p>
            
            <pre>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</pre>
            
            <p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
            household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into
            a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
            doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
            product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical
            or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the
            particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
            or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer
            product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
            industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
            significant mode of use of the product.</p>
            
            <pre>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</pre>
            
            <p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
            and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a
            modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice
            to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in
            no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been
            made.</p>
            
            <pre>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</pre>
            
            <p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
            of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
            Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
            (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
            Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
            Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
            third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
            Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
            
            <pre>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</pre>
            
            <p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
            for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the
            User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
            network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely
            affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols
            for communication across the network.</p>
            
            <pre>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</pre>
            
            <p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
            (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
            and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
            copying.</p>
            
            <pre>7. Additional Terms.&#x000A;&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</pre>
            
            <p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
            permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
            though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are
            valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part
            of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions,
            but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
            the additional permissions.</p>
            
            <pre>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</pre>
            
            <p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. 
            (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
            certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional
            permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have
            or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
            
            <pre>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</pre>
            
            <p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
            that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
            
            <pre>  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#x000A;  terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#x000A;  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#x000A;  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#x000A;  Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#x000A;&#x000A;  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#x000A;  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#x000A;  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#x000A;&#x000A;  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#x000A;  authors of the material; or&#x000A;&#x000A;  e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#x000A;  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#x000A;&#x000A;  f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#x000A;  material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#x000A;  it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#x000A;  any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#x000A;  those licensors and authors.&#x000A;&#x000A;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</pre>
            
            <p>restrictions“ within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
            received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
            governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
            you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
            restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
            may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
            document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
            relicensing or conveying.</p>
            
            <pre>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</pre>
            
            <p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
            terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
            applicable terms.</p>
            
            <pre>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</pre>
            
            <p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
            requirements apply either way.</p>
            
            <pre>8. Termination.&#x000A;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</pre>
            
            <p>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
            it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
            (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section
            11).</p>
            
            <pre>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</pre>
            
            <p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
            unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
            your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify
            you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the
            cessation.</p>
            
            <pre>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</pre>
            
            <p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
            copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
            receipt of the notice.</p>
            
            <pre>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</pre>
            
            <p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
            License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
            reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
            material under section 10.</p>
            
            <pre>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#x000A;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</pre>
            
            <p>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
            receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing
            other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any
            covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this
            License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
            indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
            
            <pre>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#x000A;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</pre>
            
            <p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
            propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for
            enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
            
            <pre>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</pre>
            
            <p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
            organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work
            results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
            receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
            party&#39;s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
            paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
            work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get
            it with reasonable efforts.</p>
            
            <pre>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</pre>
            
            <p>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not
            impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
            granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including
            a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
            is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the
            Program or any portion of it.</p>
            
            <pre>11. Patents.&#x000A;A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</pre>
            
            <p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work
            thus licensed is called the contributor&#39;s “contributor version”.</p>
            
            <pre>A contributor&#39;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</pre>
            
            <p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
            hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by
            this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
            not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
            modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition,
            “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
            consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
            
            <pre class="ruby"><span class="ruby-constant">Each</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">contributor</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">grants</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">you</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">a</span> <span class="ruby-identifier">non</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-identifier">exclusive</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">worldwide</span>, <span class="ruby-identifier">royalty</span><span class="ruby-operator">-</span><span class="ruby-identifier">free</span></pre>
            
            <p>patent license under the contributor&#39;s essential patent claims, to
            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
            propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
            
            <pre>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</pre>
            
            <p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
            as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
            patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to
            make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
            party.</p>
            
            <pre>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</pre>
            
            <p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
            copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
            publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then
            you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or
            (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for
            this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the
            requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
            recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
            for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
            your recipient&#39;s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
            one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
            believe are valid.</p>
            
            <pre>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</pre>
            
            <p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered
            work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the
            covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a
            specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
            automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
            based on it.</p>
            
            <pre>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</pre>
            
            <p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
            the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
            under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party
            to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of
            distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party
            based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which
            the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
            work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
            copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those
            copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
            compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
            arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
            
            <pre>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</pre>
            
            <p>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
            available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
            
            <pre>12. No Surrender of Others&#39; Freedom.&#x000A;If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</pre>
            
            <p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
            excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
            covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
            License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
            not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
            to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
            the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
            License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
            
            <pre>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#x000A;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</pre>
            
            <p>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under
            version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined
            work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will
            continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special
            requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
            concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as
            such.</p>
            
            <pre>14. Revised Versions of this License.&#x000A;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</pre>
            
            <p>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
            be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
            address new problems or concerns.</p>

            <p>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

            <p>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
            software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
            
            <pre>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</pre>
            
            <p>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
            the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
            “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

            <pre>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short</pre>
            
            <p>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

            <p>The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the
